# CMPG-323-Project-4---30188520
In this project I will be applying RPA and testing to the Connected Office Web Application. 

## Project Instructions

This project has little usage instructions seeing that most of the project is automated. This said the most work to be done is at the setup of the project. 
Within the project there is an Excel file with all the test data and test result data. Before you run the project ensure that the test values in the Test Sheet is all set to FALSE.
Ensure that you have logged out of the web application, because this project will do the login work for you. 
Run the project and you will see the project automatically add all the test values and tests it. 
The sequence of execution is as follow:
-	The project will first log you in to the web application.
-	Add all the zones.
-	Add all the categories.
-	Add all the devices.
-	View, edit and delete all the devices.
-	View, edit and delete all the zones.
-	View, edit and add all the categories.
-	Lastly it will update all the Test table values.
-	And thatâ€™s it, everything is automatically tested!
